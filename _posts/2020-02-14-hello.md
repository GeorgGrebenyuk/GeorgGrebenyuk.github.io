Visual novels creating is not such a difficult thing, as it might seem. And RenPy engine will help us: [http://renpy.org](http://renpy.org){:target="_blank"}. On the one hand, the engine is simple and understandable even for beginners. On the other hand, the engine is quite powerful and allows you to create really cool games. You need to download engine and install it. Nothing complicated in this process is not present, the default settings are good. Here is the RenPy main window:

There is a list of projects on left. And active project options on the right (the active project is highlighted with blue in projects list ). To create your game you need to click "Add New Project" under the list of projects. Further, the engine will ask a few simple questions. Remember the name of the game should be in English (do not use international/unicode symbols).
